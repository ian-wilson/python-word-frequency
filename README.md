Problem Statement:

Detailed below are the key points to the problem that needs solving:

• There is an input file on a Unix system, and it is plain text.

• Each line in the file contains one token (a string of arbitrary chars).

• The input file is extremely large in terms of number of lines.

• The program has as much RAM as needed.

• The program may make one pass only over the data, reading each line just once.

• At the end of the first pass, the program prints a report for each unique token that it found. It should print out the token value itself and the number of times the token was found in the data file.

• Sort order of the output does not matter, but each unique token may appear only once in the output.



Questions to Address:

• What algorithmic approach would you take and what data structures would be used?

• Why is it the best (fastest) solution?


Notes:

• This should work on a single machine.

• There is no rhyme or reason to the distribution that governs the characteristics of the string data that you may encounter

• Scalability is important and must be taken into account as part of the solution.
